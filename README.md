================

Repository for Math Proofs examples and exercises

Hi Aboo! This is my Math Proofs Repo on GitHub. If you're wondering why a bunch of the files' commit message is, "test", 
well I messed up trying to commit and push the changes at first. ALso, the commit messages used to have dates on them too :P.
